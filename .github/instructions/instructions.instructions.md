The goal of this repository is to demonstrate how react rendering works with different state management libraries. Each application should be identical from a user's perspective, with the only difference being the state management library used.

Each component should contain a render counter to display how many times it has been rendered. This will help illustrate the differences in rendering behavior between the various state management libraries.
